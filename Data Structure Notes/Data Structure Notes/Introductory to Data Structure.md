**What is Data Structure** ? - Data Structure is a way to store data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently

1. Mathematical/ Logical models{
 DATA STRUCTURE AS(We look at them as an abstract view of them or high level of them)
{
EXAMPLE:
Like a tv it has:
Turned on/off,
Recieved Signals,
audio/video
}:

ABSTRACT DATA TYPES(ADTs)
{
Defines a data and operation but with no implementation;

EXAMPLE OF ABSTRACT DATA TYPES(ADTs)
{
(this is just a model);
List = ADT(Abstract Data Type){
- Store a given number of elements;
- Read Elements by their position;
- Modify element at a position;
}
Array is a - Concrete Implementation;
}
}
}

2. Implementation
- We can implement List ADT as Linked list;

DATA STRUCTURE TO DISCUSS{
- Arrays
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph
}
