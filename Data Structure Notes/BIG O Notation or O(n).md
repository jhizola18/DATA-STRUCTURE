In programming, the notation O(n) is used to describe how the time it takes to run a piece of code grows as the input size increases. The 'n' represents the size of the input.

Imagine you have a list of numbers and you want to find a specific number in that list. If you use a simple method called linear search, you would start from the beginning of the list and check each number one by one until you find the desired number or reach the end of the list.

When we say the time complexity of this linear search algorithm is O(n), it means that the time it takes to find the number increases proportionally with the size of the list. If the list has 10 elements, it may take 10 steps. If the list has 100 elements, it may take 100 steps. The time required grows linearly with the number of elements.

So, O(n) means that as the input size (n) grows, the time it takes to perform the operation grows at a similar rate. It's like a linear relationship, where the time increases steadily as the input becomes larger.

It's important to note that O(n) is just an upper bound on the time complexity. In some cases, the actual time complexity may be lower, such as O(log n) or O(1), which means the time required grows more slowly or stays constant regardless of the input size.
